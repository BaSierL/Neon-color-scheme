# Neon.tmTheme

A cool bright-on-black theme I made for [TextMate](http://www.macromates.com) and [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2). Used mainly for [Python](http://www.python.org) and JavaScript, but lots of languages look good with it.

## Installation
In `~/Library/Application Support/` or the equivalent for your platform:

* TextMate:
    `git clone git://github.com/MattDMo/Neon.tmTheme.git TextMate/Themes`
* Sublime: `git clone git://github.com/MattDMo/Neon.tmTheme.git "Sublime Text 2/Packages/Color Scheme - Default"`
* Or, you can just download the [.zip file](https://github.com/MattDMo/Neon.tmTheme/archive/master.zip) and put it in the proper theme directory yourself.

## Customization

While I really like the level of control I get with Sublime's system of config files, editing themes by hand (in XML) is rough. So, I keep the main copies of my themes in the TextMate folder so I can use its theme editor for tweaks. In `~/Library/Application Support/` I then run `ln -s TextMate/Themes/Neon.tmTheme "Sublime Text 2/Packages/Color Scheme - Default/Neon.tmTheme"` to symlink it to Sublime.
